## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete incident response capability for handling a simulated phishing attack. All documentation follows NIST SP 800-61 (Computer Security Incident Handling Guide) and incorporates MITRE ATT&CK framework mapping for threat analysis.

**Project Type:** Simulated / Academic / Portfolio  
**Scenario:** Spearphishing attack resulting in credential compromise and unauthorized access  
**Duration:** Full incident lifecycle from detection through lessons learned

## 📝 Resume Bullets

Use these for your resume:

> **Entry-Level:**
> - Developed an incident response plan aligned with NIST SP 800-61 and conducted a tabletop exercise simulating a phishing incident

> **With Impact:**
> - Developed an incident response plan and led a tabletop exercise simulating a phishing incident, identifying control gaps and recommending remediation actions

> **Metrics-Based:**
> - Conducted a phishing incident tabletop exercise, documenting response actions, escalation paths, and post-incident improvements aligned with NIST guidelines
